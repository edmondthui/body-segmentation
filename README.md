# Tensorflow Body Segmentation

This project uses Tensorflow and bodyPix to dynamically separate the body with different colors using a trained machine learning model. 

This uses the bodyPix person body part segmentation to predict where the 24 body part segmentations for people in the video and returns a `PartSegmentation` object with the pixels of those body parts. 

## Technologies Used
* Tensorflow
* BodyPix
* React
* Javascript
* HTML / CSS
