# Tensorflow Body Segmentation

This project uses Tensorflow and bodyPix to dynamically separate the body with different colors using a trained machine learning model. 

This uses the bodyPix person body part segmentation to predict where the 24 body part segmentations for all people are and returns a `PartSegmentation` object with the pixels of those body parts.
